# GuntamaticBiostar
 
This is a custom component for Home Assistant which displays information from the Guntamatic Biostar API.
After configuration (you only have to enter the IP address of your Biostar), you can display a variety of sensors in Home Assistant.

Just make sure that you've enabled the API in your Guntamatic Biostar.
